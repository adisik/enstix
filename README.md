# enstix (storage/serial/keyboard AVR stick)

This is a firmware for ATMEL's USB capable chips (e.g. atxmega128A4U,
atxmega128A3U, atmega32U4) , which turns the device into an USB stick
pretending to be a combined Mass Storage, CDC Serial and HID/Keyboard
interface.

The whole shebang is about making an **encrypted USB storage**.

The data can be stored on a microSD card (e.g. [X-A4U-stick],
Stephan Baerwolf's [AVRstick] with a [microSD
shield](http://174763.calepin.co/uSD-shield-1.html), or [Arduino
Leonardo] or [Teensy] 2.0/++2.0 with a wired SD or microSD socket).
Alternatively, with Stephan's remarkable MassStorage bootloader on his
[AVRstick], the data can be stored inside xmega's flash (mind its
size!).

The data is encrypted with AES128 (cbc).  "Unlocking" the drive is done
by connecting to the stick via CDC Serial interface and entering the
passphrase (see the Usage instructions for more details).

To use the Serial on Windows machines, an `.inf` file is provided (not
tested). Note that it doesn't install any driver, it just lets Windows
know that it's a standard CDC Serial interface. (Like for Arduino.)

## Warnings

Using atxmega128a3u's flash as a writable USB drive is a **bad idea**,
since the flash on ATMEL's chips is *not meant to be used like this* and
has a very limited lifespan compared to usual solid-state storage (on
the order of 1000 writes?).

This is more like a *demo firmware*, which can be quite useful for
storing passwords and similar data which is small (it needs to fit into
64kB!) and don't change often. This is also why extra steps are needed
to make the storage writable.

Using a microSD for storage of course does not suffer from this problem.
Just be aware that it is still **slow** (compared to what one expects
from a microSD): I'm getting something like 130kB/sec for reading on
xmega's and about 30kB/sec on atmega32U4.

## VID/PID

Every USB device has a Vendor/Product identifying signature. This is set
in software here (`Descriptors.c`). The current code uses a pair which
belongs to the [LUFA] library. DO NOT USE IT for any other than
development purposes only! See [LUFA's VID/PID
page](http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/files/LUFA/Doc/120730/html/_page__v_i_d_p_i_d.html).

## Credits

- The whole USB interface utilizes Dean Camera's excellent [LUFA]
  library, and builds on several LUFA demos supplied with the library.
- Writing to atxmega128a3u's flash is made possible by Stephan BÃ¤rwolf's
  custom bootloader and his `apipage` example/library (see the
  [AVRstick]'s webpage).
- Software AES implementation (used for e.g. atmega32u4) for AVR comes
  from [AVR-crypto-lib].
- The (micro)SD code is based on Roland Riegel's
  [SD-reader](http://www.roland-riegel.de/sd-reader/) code.

## Compiling / installation

Generally speaking, you should compile the firmware from sources; see
the README in `sources` folder.

However, for [X-A4U-stick] there is precompiled firmware in
`binaries` directory. Even in this case, you'll need to use
a `python` script to generate a random AES key, set password and flash
the generated EEPROM file.

## Usage

When the AVR stick is first inserted, it presents itself as a USB
composite device, Mass Storage combined with CDC Serial and Keyboard.

Keyboard is there, but its functionality is not used at the moment.

Mass Storage appears as a SCSI USB drive, with one read-only
FAT12-formatted partition (ENSTIX), with one README.TXT file on it.
Nothing too interesting. (You can tweak the contents of the README file
in the sources, `Config/AppConfig.h`.)

To switch to "encrypted mode", connect to the Serial interface using
one of serial terminal programs, e.g.
[minicom](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/minicom),
[picocom](https://code.google.com/p/picocom/),
[puTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) or
even [screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/). The baud rate is not
important, any should work. For example, on linux:

        picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0 
or

        screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200

You should of course use the apropriate `ttyXXXX`, you can find it by
looking at the output of `dmesg`.

OK, so now you're talking to AVR stick via a serial terminal. Any key
other that `i`, `p`, `r`, `c` will display a short help. The individual
keys do the following:

- `i` will print some info.
- `p` will ask you for your passphrase. If entered correctly, the stick
  switches to the "encrypted mode".
- with `r` you can switch from "read-only" to "writable" and back. This
  only works in the "encrypted mode".
- with `c` you can change your passphrase.

Note that any change to the disk state (initial -> encrypted mode, or RO
to RW or back) will cause the whole stick to disconnect from USB and
then connect back after 1 second delay.

In the "encrypted mode", the Mass Storage works as a common SCSI disk
drive (size depends: either 64kB if it's flash based, or the size of
your microSD card). The only thing that the stick is doing is that
whenever the computer wants to read a sector from that "drive", the
stick will take the appopriate portion of the flash or microSD, decrypt
it and serve the result to the computer. Likewise for writing (receive
the sector contents, encrypt and save to flash or microSD). So you can
partition and format it to your liking. All the partition/filesystem
business is now done on the computer side. For flash-based version, if
you followed the set-up instructions above, then the default "contents"
of the drive will be a drive with one FAT12-formatted partition
(ENSTIXEN). For microSD-based version, you'll need to partition and
format the drive from scratch.

Once more, the xmega's flash has a *very* limited lifespan, so I
recommend enabling the RW mode only when absolutely necessary (so when
you actually need to write some data to it).

## Encryption details

The encrypted disk image is encrypted with aes128-cbc-essiv (probably
not directly compatible with other existing programs using this scheme).
So there is one main AES128 key. This one is used to encrypt each sector
(usually 512 bytes) with CBC, where the IV is derived from the key and
the sector number as described by the ESSIV scheme.

What is stored in xmega's EEPROM is the main AES128 key encrypted with
AES (the key for this is the first 16 bytes of the SHA256 hash^1000 of
the passphrase). Another piece of data stored in EEPROM is the SHA256
hash^1000 of the SHA256 hash of the passphrase (for verifying if the
entered passphrase is "correct"). (Hash^1000 means it's repeatedly
hashed, 1000 times.)

Of course, for the flash-based version, the (encrypted) disk drive image
can be easily extracted from the stick by putting it into the bootloader
mode and inspecting the contents of the `FIRMWARE.BIN` file. Likewise,
the passphrase-encrypted AES key, as well as HASH^2000(passphrase) can
be read from `EEPROM.BIN` file.

Finally, while the stick is in operation and in the "encrypted mode",
the main AES key is stored in chip's SRAM (working memory), as well as
probably in the "AES hardware module" of the chip. So it can be probably
extracted with, say, a JTAG debugger hooked up to the chip. This is the
same problem as with pretty much all the "encrypted storage" schemes
that I know - while the encryption is in operation, the key can be
extracted from the device's working memory. However, as the passphrase
is only needed for getting a hold of the main AES key, it is deleted
from the working memory after the main AES key is decrypted.

I would be grateful if you can let me know if there are some security
holes in this scheme.

## Upgrading firmware / changelog

There have been some changes to the encryption and hashing that break
disk images (namely to 1.2 and again to 1.4). Since these were very
early development stages, you'd need to ask me for instructions if you
happen to need them (it's possible to retain the data with a bit of
python).

## Remarks

In principle this firmware should compile for other USB breakouts
with ATMEL's USB capable chips (e.g. atmega32u4), but a bit of
hacking of the current code is needed.  The limitations
that come into play are:

- The number of USB endpoint that the chip can handle. This completely
  rules out atmega32u2, since that one can only do 4 endpoints and
  MassStorage+Serial requires 2+3 = 5 endpoints.
- The model that utilizes the chip's FLASH for storage requires that the
  firmware needs to be able to write to FLASH. This pretty much
  means Stephan's bootloader+apipage example on his [AVRstick].
  The microSD-based version works also on atmega32U4, but it's even
  more painfully slow than on the xmega (crypto is in firmware, and SPI
  is slower).

## Roadmap / TODO

- Figure out and implement another way of entering the passphrase that
  wouldn't require Serial access.
- Use the AVRstick's button and the Keyboard interface to "one-button
  typing password", a-la [DIY USB password
  generator](http://codeandlife.com/2012/03/03/diy-usb-password-generator/)
